Guidelines for contributing to ARP documentation and related projects.

## How to contribute

### Documentation changes

- Make edits in `arp/ARP_Docs/docs/` (Markdown + Docusaurus front matter).
- Prefer small, focused PRs (one topic per PR).
- Keep docs aligned with the current state of the **ARP Standard** and the **JARVIS implementation**; if behavior is WIP, label it explicitly.
- Add new pages under the appropriate section:
  - `docs/arp-standard/` (normative spec navigation + summaries)
  - `docs/jarvis/` and `docs/guides/` (implementation docs + walkthroughs)
  - `docs/integrations/` (interop guides)
  - `docs/api-reference/` (reference pages)
  - `docs/resources/` (glossary, FAQ, roadmap, changelog)

The sidebar is mostly autogenerated from the filesystem; keep `sidebar_position` metadata consistent when adding pages.

### Reporting issues / requesting changes

When filing an issue, include:

- which component you’re using (Runtime vs Tool Registry vs Model),
- the commands you ran,
- relevant config/env vars (redact secrets),
- and, if available, a `trace.jsonl` excerpt (or the full file if it contains no sensitive data).
