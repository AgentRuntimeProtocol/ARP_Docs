ARP/JARVIS includes a few shared helper libraries that are used across components.

:::note Scope

These libraries are not “the standard”. They are shared implementation building blocks used by JARVIS and intended to be useful for other implementations.

- LLM provider wrapper + structured output helper: [`arp-llm`](./arp-llm.md)
