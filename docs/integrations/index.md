This section covers interoperability patterns: how ARP/JARVIS can connect to other ecosystems (tool servers, agent APIs, multi-agent patterns).

:::caution WIP

Most integrations are not shipped end-to-end in the first-party JARVIS stack yet. These pages are intentionally high-level and focus on **where** an integration would plug in (for example “behind Tool Registry”).

## Start here

- For the normative HTTP+JSON contracts: [ARP Standard](../arp-standard/index.md)
- For what’s implemented today: [JARVIS Implementation](../jarvis/index.md)

## In this section

- [MCP Integration](./mcp.md)
- [Agent-to-Agent (A2A)](./agent-to-agent.md)
- [Agent Protocol Compatibility](./agent-protocol.md)
